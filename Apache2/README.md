# General Information
- This is a menu containing the most frequently used Apache commands that I use to manage my local server.
- This script is a Bash script, and Bash is a Unix shell, so it may not work on Windows by default, as Windows uses a different command-line interface (CMD or PowerShell). However, it may be possible to run this script on Windows if a Bash environment, such as Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), is installed. 

# How to run the program
Navigate to the directory where the file is stored in the terminal, then execute the following command:
~~~
$ ./apache.sh
~~~
